**Hi!**
You can find some basic code structure to getting started with React.
You are not required to do more to run this app locally.
Just follow some basic steps which I mentioned below.
  => ` npm install `
  => ` npm start `
 You are done. Just open localhost:3000 in your prefeed browser to see the result.
 
 **Happy Coding**.
