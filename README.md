**Hi!**
You can find some basic code structure in this repo to getting started with React.
You are not required to do more to run this app locally.
First run ` npm install ` then start your server by running ` npm start `.
 You are done. Just open localhost:3000 in your prefeed browser to see the result.
 
 **Happy Coding**.
